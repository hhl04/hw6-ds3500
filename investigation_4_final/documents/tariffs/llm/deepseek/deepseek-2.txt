**The Policy Shift**  
In 2018, the Trump administration launched one of the most aggressive trade overhauls in modern U.S. history, imposing sweeping tariffs on allies and adversaries alike. Citing “unfair trade practices” and prioritizing “America First,” President Donald Trump leveraged **Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act** (national security) and **Section 301 of the Trade Act** (intellectual property violations) to justify tariffs on over $360 billion in Chinese imports, 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum from most countries, and targeted duties on goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico, and others.  

The move marked a sharp departure from decades of bipartisan support for free trade, reviving protectionist policies not seen since the 1930s. Trump argued tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing, reduce trade deficits, and pressure rivals like China to reform. Critics warned of economic blowback—and they were partly right.

**Key Tariffs and Targets**  
- **China**: 25% tariffs on $250 billion of goods (tech, machinery, consumer products), later expanded to $550 billion during negotiations. Beijing retaliated with duties on U.S. soybeans, autos, and energy.  
- **Steel and Aluminum**: 25% and 10% global tariffs, sparing few allies. Canada, the EU, and Mexico faced these until exemptions were negotiated.  
- **Auto Threat**: Trump floated 25% tariffs on foreign cars, though never implemented.  
- **Section 301 Tech War**: Tariffs targeted China’s alleged IP theft, hitting semiconductors, telecom gear, and Huawei.

**Economic Impacts: Winners and Losers**  
**1. Trade Deficits and Manufacturing**  
- The U.S. trade deficit with China initially *grew* from $376 billion in 2017 to $419 billion in 2018 before dropping to $310 billion by 2020 (Census Bureau data).  
- Steel production rose modestly (6% capacity increase), but employment gains were minimal. Tariffs raised costs for manufacturers reliant on steel, such as automakers and appliance producers.  

**2. Consumer Costs and Inflation**  
- A 2019 study by the **Tax Foundation** estimated tariffs cost average households $1,277 annually. Prices spiked for washing machines (12%), electronics, and tools.  
- The Fed estimated tariffs added 0.3% to inflation by mid-2019.  

**3. Agriculture’s Pain**  
- China’s retaliatory tariffs crushed U.S. soybean exports, prompting a $28 billion federal bailout for farmers. Iowa soybean prices plummeted 20% in 2018.  

**4. Corporate Chaos**  
- Companies like Harley-Davidson shifted production overseas to avoid EU tariffs. GM and Ford warned tariffs could cost “thousands of jobs.”

**Global Reactions: Retaliation and Realignments**  
- **China**: Slapped $110 billion in retaliatory tariffs and slowed purchases of U.S. energy/agriculture. The 2020 “Phase One” deal eased tensions but failed to meet $200 billion purchase targets.  
- **EU**: Imposed $3.2 billion in tariffs on bourbon, motorcycles, and jeans, targeting politically sensitive U.S. industries.  
- **Canada/Mexico**: Counter-tariffs on U.S. goods until exemptions were granted. Both later signed the **USMCA**, which replaced NAFTA but kept steel/aluminum tariffs temporarily.  
- **WTO**: Ruled U.S. steel tariffs illegal in 2022, but the Biden administration maintained them.

**Legacy and Long-Term Effects**  
- **Supply Chain Shifts**: Companies diversified from China to Vietnam, Mexico, and India.  
- **Biden’s Approach**: Maintained most Trump-era tariffs while seeking “worker-centric” trade deals and subsidies like the CHIPS Act.  
- **Political Divide**: Republicans largely praised tariffs as tough negotiation; Democrats called them costly and chaotic.  

**Expert Take**:  
“The tariffs were a blunt instrument,” says Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “They highlighted China’s unfair practices but hurt U.S. competitiveness and allies. The long-term lesson? Unilateral tariffs are a risky gambit in a globalized world.”
