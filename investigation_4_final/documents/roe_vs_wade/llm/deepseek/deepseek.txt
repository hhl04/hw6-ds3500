**Roe v. Wade: A Landmark Decision Overturned, Reshaping America’s Abortion Landscape**

**The Historic Ruling (1973)**  
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court issued one of the most consequential decisions in modern American history: *Roe v. Wade*. By a 7-2 vote, the Court ruled that the constitutional right to privacy, grounded in the **14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause**, protects a person’s right to choose an abortion. The decision struck down state laws banning abortion outright, establishing a framework that allowed unrestricted access in the first trimester of pregnancy and permitting regulations in later stages to protect maternal health.  

Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, argued that the “right to privacy… is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” The ruling ignited immediate controversy, galvanizing both the **pro-choice movement**, which hailed it as a victory for bodily autonomy, and the **pro-life movement**, which condemned it as judicial overreach.

**The Road to Overturning (1992–2022)**  
For decades, *Roe* faced legal challenges. In 1992, the Supreme Court revisited the issue in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, upholding *Roe*’s core holding but replacing its trimester framework with a new standard: States could regulate abortion as long as they did not impose an “**undue burden**” on access. This opened the door to restrictions like waiting periods and mandatory counseling.  

The balance shifted dramatically with the confirmation of three conservative justices under President Donald Trump, solidifying a 6-3 conservative majority. In 2022, the Court took up *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*, a case challenging Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. On June 24, 2022, the Court issued a seismic ruling: **5-4 to uphold Mississippi’s law** and **6-3 to overturn *Roe* entirely**.  

Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, declared *Roe* “egregiously wrong from the start,” arguing that the Constitution does not mention abortion and that regulating it should be left to states. The dissent, authored by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, warned that the decision “undermines the Court’s legitimacy” and “jeopardizes other rights rooted in privacy,” such as contraception and same-sex marriage.

**The Post-Roe Era: A Nation Divided**  
The fallout was swift and stark. Trigger laws banning abortion immediately took effect in 13 states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Today, **21 states** heavily restrict or ban abortion, while 17 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted protections. Key developments include:  

- **“Abortion Tourism”**: Patients in restrictive states increasingly travel to hubs like Illinois, New Mexico, and California. Clinics in border states report patient surges of 500–1,000%.  
- **Economic and Health Impacts**: Studies project a 21% rise in maternal mortality in restrictive states, disproportionately affecting Black and low-income women (Guttmacher Institute). Companies like Amazon and Disney now cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions.  
- **Legal Battles**: States like Idaho and Texas have sought to criminalize aiding out-of-state abortions, while progressive states shield providers from prosecution.

**Public Opinion and Activism**  
Polls show a majority of Americans disapprove of *Roe*’s overturning (58%, Pew Research), but views remain deeply polarized. Grassroots movements have mobilized on both sides:  
- **Pro-choice groups** have won ballot initiatives protecting abortion rights in Kansas, Michigan, and Ohio.  
- **Pro-life advocates** push for federal restrictions, including a proposed 15-week national ban.  

Social media has amplified the fight, with TikTok campaigns like #AbortionIsHealthcare sharing resources, while anti-abortion groups use geofencing to target ads near clinics.

**Global Repercussions**  
The U.S. joins Poland and El Salvador in rolling back abortion access, drawing condemnation from the UN and European leaders. Canada, meanwhile, has expanded services for Americans, with clinics in Ontario and British Columbia reporting a 30% increase in U.S. patients.

**What’s Next?**  
The battle is far from over. Key questions loom:  
- Will Congress codify abortion rights or enact a federal ban?  
- Could the Supreme Court revisit precedents like *Griswold* (contraception) or *Obergefell* (same-sex marriage), as Justice Clarence Thomas urged in his *Dobbs* concurrence?  
- How will the issue shape the 2024 elections?  

Legal scholar Mary Ziegler summarizes: “*Dobbs* didn’t end the abortion debate—it unleashed a new era of conflict, state by state, court by court.”
