### The Rise and Fall of Roe v. Wade: A Half-Century of Controversy

#### By [Your Friendly Neighborhood Journalist], April 7, 2025

Imagine it’s 1969 in Dallas, Texas. A 22-year-old woman, Norma McCorvey, finds herself pregnant with her third child. She’s broke, unmarried, and desperate for an abortion—but Texas law says no, unless her life’s at stake. That moment sparked a legal firestorm that would change America forever: Roe v. Wade. For nearly 50 years, it stood as the cornerstone of abortion rights, until a seismic shift in 2022 brought it crashing down. Here’s the story of how it happened—and what it means today.

#### A Fight Born in Texas
McCorvey, later known as “Jane Roe” to protect her identity, wasn’t looking to become a symbol. She just wanted out of a tough spot. Two young lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, saw her case as a chance to challenge Texas’s near-total abortion ban. They argued it violated a woman’s right to privacy—a right they said was hiding in the U.S. Constitution, even if it wasn’t spelled out. By 1971, their fight landed before the Supreme Court, with McCorvey’s personal struggle now a stand-in for millions of women.

On January 22, 1973, the Court delivered its verdict: 7-2 in favor of Roe. Justice Harry Blackmun, a soft-spoken Nixon appointee, wrote the decision. He said the Fourteenth Amendment’s promise of liberty included a woman’s choice to end a pregnancy—at least early on. The ruling split pregnancy into three stages: states couldn’t meddle much in the first trimester, could set health rules in the second, and could ban abortion in the third, when a fetus might survive outside the womb. Overnight, laws in 46 states crumbled, and abortion became legal across the land.

#### Cheers, Jeers, and a Divided Nation
The reaction was electric. Women’s rights groups cheered, seeing Roe as a win for freedom and equality. “This is about a woman’s right to control her own body,” one activist told reporters outside the Court. But not everyone was celebrating. Religious leaders and conservative activists cried foul, calling it a “license to kill.” Within months, groups like the National Right to Life Committee were rallying to fight back. Protests flared—peaceful marches turned into shouting matches outside clinics.

For everyday Americans, it was a mixed bag. A Gallup poll that year showed most thought abortion should be private, but the divide grew sharper over time. By the 1980s, Roe wasn’t just a court case—it was a political lightning rod. Republicans started vowing to overturn it; Democrats swore to defend it. Meanwhile, abortion clinics popped up nationwide, handling over a million procedures a year by the mid-70s, according to the Guttmacher Institute. For many, it was a quiet lifeline; for others, a moral outrage.

#### Holding the Line—Until It Snapped
Roe faced constant attacks. States threw up hurdles—waiting periods, parental consent rules, clinic regulations—testing its limits. In 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey gave it a lifeline, keeping the core right alive but letting states add more restrictions. Still, Roe held firm, shaping lives. Studies later showed women who got abortions were less likely to sink into poverty or face health crises, a ripple effect that touched millions.

But the ground was shifting. After decades of conservative pushback, the Supreme Court got a makeover under President Trump, with three new justices tipping the balance. On June 24, 2022, the hammer fell: Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In a 5-4 vote, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that Roe was “egregiously wrong” and had no constitutional roots. Abortion wasn’t a federal right anymore—it was up to the states. Just like that, 49 years of precedent vanished.

#### The Aftermath: A Nation Split in Two
The fallout was instant. Within weeks, 13 states rolled out near-total bans, some with no exceptions for rape or incest. Places like Texas and Alabama turned back the clock, while states like California and New York doubled down, expanding access. Clinics shut down in the South and Midwest; women started crossing state lines or ordering pills online. Protests erupted—thousands marched in Washington, D.C., waving signs reading “My Body, My Choice” or “Life Begins at Conception.”

The economic hit was real, too. The Brookings Institution pegged the cost of bans at $105 billion a year—think lost jobs, higher healthcare bills, and struggling families. On the flip side, anti-abortion advocates celebrated a “new era” for protecting life. “This is what we’ve prayed for,” one leader told me at a rally last month.

#### Where We Stand Today
As I write this on April 7, 2025, the dust hasn’t settled. Congress is gridlocked—Democrats push to codify abortion rights, Republicans eye a national ban. States are a patchwork: bans in some, sanctuaries in others. Norma McCorvey, who passed away in 2017, lived to see her case spark both a revolution and its reversal. She once said she felt used by both sides—a footnote in a fight that outgrew her.

For the average person, it’s personal. A nurse in Ohio told me she’s seen patients scramble for options since Dobbs. A pastor in Georgia said his congregation feels “vindicated.” Roe v. Wade’s story isn’t over—it’s just taken a sharp turn. What happens next depends on voters, lawmakers, and maybe the courts again. One thing’s clear: this isn’t just history. It’s today’s front page.
