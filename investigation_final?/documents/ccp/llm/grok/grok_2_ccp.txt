The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Founded in 1921, it is a Marxist-Leninist organization that has governed China since 1949, when it emerged victorious in the Chinese Civil War against the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). The CCP is the sole governing party in mainland China, exercising centralized control over the state, military, and economy.

The party’s ideology is officially based on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and, in more recent decades, Deng Xiaoping Theory, along with the concept of "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics." Under its current leader, Xi Jinping, the CCP has emphasized "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era," which was enshrined in the party constitution in 2017. The CCP maintains a one-party system, meaning no other political parties are permitted to challenge its authority, and it suppresses dissent to preserve its monopoly on power.

The CCP’s structure is hierarchical, with the National Congress serving as its highest formal body, though real power lies in the Politburo and its Standing Committee, currently led by Xi Jinping as General Secretary. The party claims to represent the interests of the Chinese people, focusing on economic development, national sovereignty, and social stability. It has overseen China’s transformation into a global economic powerhouse while maintaining strict control over political expression, media, and civil society.

With over 90 million members, the CCP is one of the largest political organizations in the world. Its influence extends beyond China through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and its role in international organizations, though it faces criticism from some quarters for human rights abuses, censorship, and aggressive foreign policy.
