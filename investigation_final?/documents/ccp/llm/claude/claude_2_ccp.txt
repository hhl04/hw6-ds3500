The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China. Founded in 1921, it came to power in mainland China in 1949 under the leadership of Mao Zedong after winning the Chinese Civil War.

Key aspects of the CCP include:

- It operates as the sole governing party of China within a one-party state system
- It has over 95 million members, making it one of the largest political parties in the world
- The party follows an ideology that combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics
- It maintains control over the government, military, and media in China
- The party's highest body is the National Congress, which meets every five years
- The Politburo Standing Committee, led by the General Secretary (currently Xi Jinping), holds the most power

The CCP has overseen China's transformation from a predominantly agrarian society to the world's second-largest economy, implementing significant economic reforms starting in the late 1970s while maintaining strict political control.
