Here’s a reconstructed **hypothetical prompt** that could generate a detailed analysis of the *Roe v. Wade* case, mirroring the structured, data-driven approach of the earlier tariff article. The prompt would likely request a historical overview, legal evolution, societal impact, and post-*Dobbs* consequences:

---

**Prompt:**  
"Write an in-depth analytical article titled *'Roe v. Wade: A Landmark Case and Its Unraveling.'* Structure the piece as follows:  

1. **Introduction**:  
   - Open with the 1973 Supreme Court decision and its immediate significance.  
   - Contrast with the 2022 *Dobbs v. Jackson* ruling that overturned it.  

2. **Historical Context**:  
   - Explain the pre-*Roe* landscape: state abortion bans, maternal mortality, and the feminist movement.  
   - Detail Jane Roe’s (Norma McCorvey) lawsuit against Henry Wade, Dallas DA.  

3. **The 1973 Decision**:  
   - Outline Justice Blackmun’s majority opinion:  
     - Constitutional right to privacy under the 14th Amendment.  
     - Trimester framework balancing state interests and individual rights.  
   - Note dissenting opinions (e.g., Rehnquist’s critique of judicial overreach).  

4. **Societal and Political Impact**:  
   - Polarization: Rise of pro-choice and pro-life movements.  
   - Legislative battles:  
     - Hyde Amendment (1976) banning federal funding for abortions.  
     - State TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers).  
   - Public opinion trends (Gallup polls showing stable split).  

5. **Key Subsequent Cases**:  
   - *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992):  
     - Replaced trimester framework with ‘undue burden’ standard.  
     - Upheld *Roe*’s core but allowed state restrictions.  
   - *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007): Upheld federal ban on partial-birth abortion.  

6. **The Road to *Dobbs***:  
   - Role of judicial appointments (Trump’s three conservative justices).  
   - Mississippi’s 15-week ban (the *Dobbs* case) and its challenge to *Roe*.  
   - Leaked draft opinion (2022) and public protests.  

7. **The *Dobbs* Decision (2022)**:  
   - Alito’s majority opinion:  
     - Rejection of constitutional right to abortion.  
     - ‘History and tradition’ as legal basis.  
   - Dissents (Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan): Warnings about privacy rights (contraception, same-sex marriage).  

8. **Post-*Dobbs* Fallout**:  
   - Immediate state bans (trigger laws in 13 states).  
   - Health care disparities:  
     - 14+ states with near-total bans as of 2024.  
     - Travel for abortion (e.g., 40% increase in out-of-state patients in Illinois).  
   - Economic and social impacts:  
     - Maternal mortality risks (studies showing 33% rise in ban states).  
     - Corporate responses (Amazon, Disney offering travel benefits).  

9. **Global Reactions**:  
   - International criticism (UN Human Rights Office, Macron).  
   - Counter-movements: Argentina’s 2020 legalization vs. U.S. restrictions.  

10. **Conclusion**:  
    - Legacy of *Roe*: Did it politicize the Court?  
    - Future scenarios: Federal abortion ban vs. state-by-state battles.  
    - Broader implications for privacy rights and judicial precedent.  

**Requirements**:  
- Cite real rulings, politicians (e.g., McConnell, Ginsburg), and advocacy groups (ACLU, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America).  
- Include statistics (CDC abortion rates, Guttmacher Institute data).  
- Maintain neutrality: Represent pro-choice and pro-life arguments fairly.  
- Use quotes from scholars (e.g., Mary Ziegler) and activists (e.g., Loretta Ross)."

### Key Elements in the Prompt:  
- **Chronological Flow**: From *Roe*’s origins to *Dobbs* and beyond.  
- **Legal Specificity**: Focus on constitutional reasoning and precedent.  
- **Data-Driven**: Polls, health outcomes, legislative trends.  
- **Balanced Perspective**: Both sides of the debate (e.g., privacy rights vs. state interests).  
- **Modern Relevance**: Post-*Dobbs* realities and global context.  

This prompt would generate a nuanced analysis of how *Roe* reshaped U.S. law, society, and politics, while highlighting the destabilizing impact of its reversal.
