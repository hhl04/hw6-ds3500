### Key Points
- Research suggests Roe v. Wade was a 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide.
- It seems likely the decision was based on a constitutional right to privacy, overturned in 2022.
- The evidence leans toward states now determining abortion laws, with varied restrictions as of April 2025.
- This remains a sensitive topic with ongoing legal and political debates.

### Background
Roe v. Wade, decided on January 22, 1973, was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized abortion across the country. The Court ruled that the Constitution protects a person's right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability, based on the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment.

### Overturning and Impact
In June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ruling there is no constitutional right to abortion. This decision shifted authority to regulate abortion to individual states, leading to a patchwork of laws.

### Current Status
As of April 2025, abortion laws vary by state. Some states have imposed near-total bans, while others protect or expand access, with ongoing legal challenges and ballot measures influencing the landscape. For example, 19 states have restrictive laws, and several have enshrined abortion rights in their constitutions.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Roe v. Wade

This section provides a detailed examination of the Roe v. Wade case, its historical context, legal implications, and current status as of April 5, 2025, aiming to offer a thorough understanding for readers interested in the legal and social dimensions of abortion rights in the United States. The analysis is structured to mimic a professional article, ensuring a strict superset of the content in the direct answer section, with additional details and supporting evidence.

#### Historical Context and 1973 Decision
Roe v. Wade, decided on January 22, 1973, was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Jane Roe (Norma McCorvey) v. Henry Wade, the District Attorney of Dallas County, Texas. The Court ruled 7-2 that unduly restrictive state regulation of abortion is unconstitutional, establishing that the Constitution protects a person's right to choose to have an abortion prior to fetal viability. This right was based on the right to privacy implied in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, as supported by earlier cases like Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which recognized a right to privacy in marital relations.

The decision struck down many state laws that criminalized abortion, particularly Texas statutes that allowed abortion only to save the mother's life. It established a trimester-based framework: in the first trimester, states could not regulate abortion; in the second, they could regulate for maternal health; and in the third, they could prohibit abortion except to protect the mother's life or health. This framework governed reproductive rights for nearly 50 years, sparking ongoing debates about the legality of abortion, the role of moral and religious views in politics, and the Supreme Court's methods in constitutional adjudication.

#### Key Parties and Legal Proceedings
The case was brought by Norma McCorvey, using the pseudonym "Jane Roe," who was pregnant and sought an abortion but lived in Texas where it was illegal except to save the mother's life. She was joined by a licensed physician, Dr. Hallford, who faced prosecution for performing abortions, and a childless married couple, the Does, who challenged the laws based on future possibilities. The District Court consolidated the actions, ruling in favor of Roe and Hallford, which led to the Supreme Court appeal.

#### Overturning in 2022: Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, with a 5-4 decision. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., held that there is no constitutional right to abortion, arguing that the right to privacy does not extend to abortion and that such matters should be left to the states. This decision abandoned nearly 50 years of precedent, marking the first time the Court took away a fundamental right, as noted by the Center for Reproductive Rights ([Roe v. Wade - Center for Reproductive Rights](https://reproductiverights.org/roe-v-wade/)).

The overturning was preceded by a draft opinion leak in May 2022, dated February 2022, published by a political news outlet, which heightened public and political tension. The decision led to immediate impacts, with several states adopting laws drastically limiting abortion availability, often through "trigger laws" enacted before the ruling.

#### Current Status as of April 2025
As of April 5, 2025, Roe v. Wade remains overturned, and abortion laws are determined at the state level, creating a deeply uneven landscape. According to recent tracking by The New York Times ([Abortion Bans Across the Country: Tracking Restrictions by State](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html)), 19 states ban abortion or restrict it earlier than the standard set by Roe v. Wade, with 12 states enacting near-total bans and 4 states (Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Iowa) banning abortion past roughly six weeks, as reported by The Guardian ([Tracking abortion laws across the United States | Roe v Wade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state)).

Conversely, several states have moved to protect or expand access. For instance, ballot measures in November 2024 saw 7 out of 10 states approving amendments to overturn bans or enshrine abortion rights, with states like California, Colorado, and Michigan enshrining protections in their constitutions. The legal fight continues, with ongoing court challenges in states like Missouri, where the attorney general is expected to appeal a ruling allowing abortion to resume, and Utah, where the Supreme Court upheld a block on a near-total ban while challenges proceed.

The following table summarizes the state-by-state status as of February 18, 2025, based on The Guardian's tracker, with updates reflecting recent ballot measures and court decisions:

This table reflects the diverse approaches, with states like California and New York protecting access, while states like Alabama and Texas impose strict bans. The ongoing legal battles, such as in Missouri and North Dakota, highlight the fluidity of the situation, with potential for further changes.

#### Recent Developments and Policy Proposals
Recent discussions, particularly around Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda, propose further restrictions, such as using the Comstock Act to ban mailing abortion pills, potentially affecting all states ([Project 2025: what does the rightwing blueprint say about abortion? | Project 2025 | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/project-2025-abortion)). However, as of April 2025, these are proposals and not yet law, with their implementation uncertain given political and legal hurdles.

Research from February 2025, such as an article in the American Journal of Managed Care ([Abortion in 2025: Access, Fertility, and Infant Mortality Updates](https://www.ajmc.com/view/abortion-in-2025-access-fertility-and-infant-mortality-updates)), notes Republican-led efforts to increase restrictions, particularly on medication abortion like mifepristone and misoprostol, reflecting ongoing legislative interference impacting patient and physician well-being.

#### Social and Political Implications
The overturning of Roe v. Wade has led to significant social and political ramifications, with protests, ballot initiatives, and legal challenges shaping the discourse. The uneven access, with clinics cut off in the South and Midwest but standing strong on both coasts, as per The Guardian's tracker, underscores the regional disparities. Ballot measures in 2024, with seven states approving protections, indicate public support for abortion rights in some areas, yet the controversy persists, with ongoing debates about emergency care, medication abortion, and interstate travel for services.

#### Conclusion
Roe v. Wade, once a cornerstone of abortion rights, was overturned in 2022, shifting the legal framework to the states. As of April 2025, the landscape is marked by significant variation, with bans in 19 states and protections in others, reflecting a complex and evolving battle over reproductive rights. This analysis, drawing on recent sources, provides a comprehensive view, acknowledging the sensitivity and ongoing nature of the topic.
