Based on your request, I'll provide factual information about the Roe v. Wade case.
Roe v. Wade was a landmark Supreme Court decision issued on January 22, 1973. The case centered on a Texas law that prohibited abortion except to save the mother's life. Jane Roe (a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey) challenged the constitutionality of this law.
In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a fundamental "right to privacy" that protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose whether to have an abortion.
The Court established a trimester framework for balancing a woman's right to abortion with the state's interest in potential life:

During the first trimester, abortion decisions were left to the woman and her doctor
During the second trimester, states could regulate abortion procedures in ways reasonably related to maternal health
During the third trimester, states could regulate or prohibit abortion except where necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother

Roe v. Wade was subsequently modified by Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which replaced the trimester framework with an "undue burden" standard.
On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, ruling that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. This decision returned the authority to regulate abortion to the individual states.2 / 2RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
