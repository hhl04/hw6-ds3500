# Economic Impact of Tariffs

Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services, and they have multifaceted economic impacts:

## Domestic Effects
- **Price increases**: Tariffs typically raise prices for consumers on imported goods
- **Protection for domestic industries**: Local producers face less foreign competition
- **Employment effects**: May preserve jobs in protected industries while reducing jobs in industries that use imported inputs
- **Government revenue**: Tariffs generate tax revenue for the government

## International Effects
- **Trade reduction**: Higher tariffs generally reduce overall trade volumes
- **Retaliation risk**: Trading partners often respond with their own tariffs
- **Global supply chain disruption**: Can fragment production networks and increase costs

## Economic Efficiency
- **Deadweight loss**: Tariffs create market inefficiencies by distorting prices
- **Resource misallocation**: Can keep resources in less productive sectors
- **Innovation impacts**: Reduced competition may decrease incentives to innovate

## Distributional Effects
- **Winners and losers**: Benefits concentrated in protected industries, costs spread across consumers
- **Income distribution**: Often regressive, with lower-income households spending more of their income on goods

Economists generally find that while tariffs may benefit specific industries and workers, they tend to impose greater overall costs than benefits on the economy as a whole.
