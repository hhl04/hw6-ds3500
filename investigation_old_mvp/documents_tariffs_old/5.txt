Tariffs can have a **significant economic impact**, and their effects depend on how they're structured, who they're applied to, and how other countries respond. Here's a breakdown of the **main economic impacts of tariffs**:

---

### 🔺 **1. Higher Prices for Consumers**
- **Tariffs raise the cost** of imported goods.
- Domestic producers may raise their prices since foreign competition becomes more expensive.
- **Result**: Consumers pay more.

**Example:** A 25% tariff on steel makes everything from cars to washing machines more expensive.

---

### 🏭 **2. Protection for Domestic Industries**
- Tariffs help protect local businesses from cheaper foreign competition.
- May boost jobs and investment in **protected sectors** (like steel, aluminum, etc.).
- **However**, this often comes at the **expense of other industries** that rely on imported inputs.

---

### 🔁 **3. Retaliation and Trade Wars**
- Other countries often retaliate with their **own tariffs**.
- Can escalate into **trade wars** that hurt **global trade**, reduce exports, and shake investor confidence.

---

### 📉 **4. Distorted Market Efficiency**
- Tariffs reduce trade and may keep inefficient domestic industries afloat.
- This **diverts resources** away from more productive sectors.
- **Long-term**: Can slow **economic growth** and **innovation**.

---

### 📊 **5. Government Revenue (Short-Term)**
- Tariffs can bring in revenue for governments.
- But this is generally **short-term** and limited, especially if trade volumes fall in response.

---

### 🧩 **6. Impact Varies by Sector and Country**
- **Export-heavy sectors** suffer more from retaliation.
- **Import-reliant sectors** face higher costs.
- **Developing countries** may be hit harder, depending on trade dependency.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Example:
**U.S.-China trade war (2018–2020):**
- The U.S. imposed tariffs on $360B+ of Chinese goods.
- China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports (like soybeans).
- **Outcomes**: 
  - U.S. farmers hit hard, requiring subsidies.
  - U.S. consumers paid more.
  - Global supply chains disrupted.
