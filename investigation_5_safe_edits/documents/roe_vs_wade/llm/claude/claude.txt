# The Landmark Case That Defined Abortion Rights in America

In the annals of American jurisprudence, few Supreme Court decisions have shaped the national conversation as profoundly as Roe v. Wade. Decided on January 22, 1973, this watershed ruling fundamentally altered the legal landscape surrounding reproductive rights in the United States.

The case began when Norma McCorvey—under the pseudonym "Jane Roe"—challenged a Texas statute that criminalized abortion except to save a mother's life. Representing the state was Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County. At its core, the legal question addressed whether the Constitution recognized a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy.

In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provided a "right to privacy" that protected a woman's right to an abortion. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, articulated a trimester framework balancing women's rights against state interests.

The ruling wasn't without opposition. Dissenters Justice Byron White and Justice William Rehnquist argued that the Constitution contained no right to abortion and that the Court had overstepped its authority.

For nearly five decades, Roe stood as precedent, though subsequent cases modified its framework. Most notably, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) replaced the trimester approach with an "undue burden" standard while affirming Roe's essential holding.

The constitutional landscape changed dramatically on June 24, 2022, when the Court overturned Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Writing for the 6-3 majority, Justice Samuel Alito declared that "the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion," returning regulatory authority to individual states.

This reversal triggered immediate effects across the country, with some states quickly imposing restrictions while others moved to protect abortion access. The decision reignited one of America's most divisive public debates—one that continues to influence politics, healthcare policy, and personal lives nationwide.
