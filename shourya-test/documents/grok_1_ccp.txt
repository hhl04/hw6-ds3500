The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Founded in 1921, it is a Marxist-Leninist party that has governed China since 1949, when it emerged victorious in the Chinese Civil War against the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). The CCP is the sole governing party in mainland China, controlling the government, military (People's Liberation Army), and major institutions through a one-party system.

The party's ideology is officially based on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and, in modern times, "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics," a framework introduced by Deng Xiaoping that incorporates market-oriented reforms while maintaining centralized political control. Under its current leader, Xi Jinping, the CCP has emphasized "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era," which reinforces the party's authority, national sovereignty, and economic development.

The CCP's structure is hierarchical, with the National Congress serving as its highest formal body, though real power lies in the Politburo and its Standing Committee, currently led by Xi Jinping as General Secretary. The party claims to represent the interests of the Chinese people, promoting goals like national rejuvenation, poverty alleviation, and technological advancement. It maintains strict control over media, education, and dissent, often citing stability and unity as justification.

With over 98 million members as of recent estimates, the CCP is one of the largest political organizations in the world. Its influence extends globally through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and its role in international organizations, though it faces criticism from some quarters for human rights practices and authoritarian governance.
