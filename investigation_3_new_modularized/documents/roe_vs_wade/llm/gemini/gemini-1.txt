2.5 PRO EXPERIMENTAL

What it Was: Roe v. Wade was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court issued on January 22, 1973.   
The Core Ruling: The Court ruled (7–2) that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a fundamental "right to privacy" that protects a pregnant person's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion.   
The Framework: The ruling established a framework based on the trimesters of pregnancy:
First Trimester: Governments could not prohibit abortions at all.
Second Trimester: Governments could impose regulations on abortion that were reasonably related to maternal health.   
Third Trimester: Once the fetus reached viability (the potential to survive outside the womb, determined to be around the start of the third trimester), states could regulate or even prohibit abortions, except where necessary to save the life or health of the pregnant person.
Impact: This decision struck down many federal and state abortion laws that were in place at the time and effectively legalized abortion nationwide, establishing a baseline right across the country. It remains one of the most controversial and politically significant Supreme Court decisions in U.S. history.
Crucial Update: Overturning of Roe v. Wade

The Dobbs Decision: On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.   
The Ruling: In the Dobbs decision, the Court explicitly overruled Roe v. Wade and the subsequent Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) decision, which had largely reaffirmed Roe. The Court held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.   
The Consequence: The authority to regulate or prohibit abortion was returned to the individual states. This means abortion legality and access now vary significantly depending on state law, leading to widespread legal and political battles across the United States.
In summary, Roe v. Wade was the 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion based on the right to privacy. However, this precedent was overturned in June 2022 by the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, and abortion law is now determined at the state level.
