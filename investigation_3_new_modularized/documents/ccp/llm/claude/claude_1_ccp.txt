The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China. Founded in 1921, it came to power in mainland China in 1949 after winning the Chinese Civil War against the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), which retreated to Taiwan.

As the sole governing party of China, the CCP maintains a monopoly on power and exercises control over all aspects of government, military, and media. It follows an ideology that combines Marxism-Leninism with various Chinese political philosophies, often referred to as "socialism with Chinese characteristics" in recent decades.

The party is organized hierarchically, with the National Party Congress at the top, followed by the Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Politburo Standing Committee, which is the highest decision-making body. The General Secretary of the CCP serves as the party's leader and typically also holds the positions of President of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

Under the CCP's leadership, China has undergone significant economic reforms since the late 1970s, transitioning from a centrally planned economy to what they describe as a "socialist market economy," which incorporates many elements of capitalism while maintaining state control over key sectors.
