Our Journey

picking an idea:
- run local & cloud models
- search agents
- context windows
- how to truly measure intelligence...?
- narrowing scope to just output text

- pivoting to search agents as well to examine company bias in the design of their products/agents

- specific topic: China vs US LLMS
- racial bias
- final vote: roe v wade ; because of context
